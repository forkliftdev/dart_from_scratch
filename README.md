# dart_from_scratch
My notes on Dart, written as Dart code. Documenting my transition from forklift driver to coder. Forks down, code up.


🚧 About This Project
I am a 59-year-old forklift driver documenting the real journey of learning to code from scratch.
This repository acts as my digital notebook. Instead of writing notes in a separate document, I write them inside the code files as comments. This allows me to explain the logic to myself and run the code to see the results instantly.
Core Values:
 * Authenticity: Showing the real process, including the syntax errors.
 * Process Over Perfection: It doesn't have to be pretty; it just has to compile.
 * Manual to Digital: Moving from moving pallets to moving pixels.
📂 Structure
The files are roughly organized by the concepts I am currently tackling:
 * basics/ - Syntax, variables, and data types.
 * control_flow/ - Loops, if/else logic.
 * functions/ - Writing reusable code blocks.
 * challenges/ - Specific coding problems I've tried to solve.
🚀 How to Run
If you are learning alongside me, you can clone this repo and run the files using the Dart SDK.
 * Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/forkliftdev/dart-learning-log.git

 * Navigate to the folder:
   cd dart_from_scratch

 * Run a specific file:
   dart run basics/variables.dart

📺 Follow the Journey
This code is the "behind the scenes" of my YouTube channel, where I share the motivation, the struggles, and the wins.
